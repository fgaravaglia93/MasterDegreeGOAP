Moody5: Personality-biased agents to enhance interactive storytelling in video games.

Moody5 is a plugin for Unity 3D developed for my Master Degree final exam at Università degli Studi di Milano.

The plugin was designed to enhance the players’ gameplay experience and increase the replay value, adding variability to
the behavior of NPCs.

 Moody5’s features include:
  -  an editor to create NPCs with personality while helping the designer to define the agent’s characteristics;
  -  a graphical user interface to monitor the behavior of an agent at runtime;
  -  a visual editor to create interactive multi-answer dialogues sensitive to variations of emotions and different
personalities that extends an open source prievous work: Available at: https://github.com/merpheus-dev/NodeBasedDialogueSystem  .

Agent’s behavior is defined using a variant of the GOAP algorithm that is sensitive to the NPCs personality.
This variant includes a model based on the five dimensions of the Big Five theory, a model of transitions between Ekman’s primary
emotions and some ad hoc personality traits that create specific NPC behaviors.

Notes: the plugin was developed with Unity 2019 LTS
